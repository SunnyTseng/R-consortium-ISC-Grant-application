# Executive Summary

```{=html}
<!--
This section provides a condensed view of the entire proposal, one page long.
It should be a comprehensive high-level overview that captures the essence of the proposal, including its goals, methods, expected outcomes, deliverables, and budget.
-->
```



Passive acoustic monitoring is transforming biodiversity research, allowing scientists to study birds across vast landscapes using audio recordings. Machine learning tools such as BirdNET can automatically identify thousands of species, but converting its outputs into the structured format required for occupancy modeling—a key method for estimating where species occur and how likely they are to be detected—remains a major hurdle. `birdnetTools 2.0` will remove this barrier by expanding the existing package to produce detection matrices compatible with widely used occupancy modeling R packages: `spOccupancy`, `unmarked`, and `ubms`. By streamlining data import, cleaning, validation, and preparation for modeling, this upgrade will make it easier for researchers and conservationists to generate reproducible occupancy estimates from raw audio recordings. The project will also include step-by-step tutorials and example workflows, empowering ecologists to monitor bird populations at large scales and strengthening the R ecosystem for biodiversity science.

BirdNET is a leading algorithm for automated bird species identification from audio recordings, capable of recognizing over 6,000 species [@kahl:2021]. R packages such as `birdnetR` (for running BirdNET) [@gunther:2025] and `birdnetTools` (for post-processing outputs) [@tseng:2025r] already streamline acoustic analyses. A key application of BirdNET results is occupancy modeling, which estimates species occurrence and detectability [@wood:2023]. However, occupancy packages in R—such as `unmarked` [@fiske:2011], `ubms` [@kellner:2021], and `spOccupancy` [@doser:2022]—require tightly structured detection matrices that are difficult to prepare from BirdNET’s raw predictions. This formatting hurdle slows analysis and discourages ecologists who lack advanced programming skills.

Enhancing birdnetTools to directly convert BirdNET predictions into model-ready detection matrices will close this gap, enabling researchers and conservation practitioners to move efficiently from raw audio to reproducible occupancy estimates.

What does the high-level architecture look like?

```


`birdnetTools 2.0` will streamline the workflow from BirdNET outputs to occupancy models in R (@fig-workflow A). The package will produce the **detection matrix**, a (site × survey) matrix indicating species presence (1), absence (0), or missing data (NA), ready for use in `spOccupancy`, `unmarked`, and `ubms`. Building on existing functions for data import, cleaning, and validation, new core functions (e.g., `birdnet_det_mat()`) will extract site and survey information, aggregate detections, and reshape outputs into the formats required by these occupancy packages (@fig-workflow B). Example vignettes will guide users through end-to-end analyses, from BirdNET predictions to occupancy modeling results, with minimal additional coding.

## Minimum viable product and external dependencies

against the problem.

Depending on project type the detail section should include:

```

```{=html}
<!--
What is the smallest thing you can build that delivers value to your users?
-->
```



The minimum viable product will be a core function, `birdnet_det_mat()`, which converts BirdNET’s long-format prediction tables into a site × survey **detection matrix**, the critical missing piece in the existing software ecosystem. This matrix will contain 1s (species detected above a specified confidence score), 0s (audio recorded but no qualifying detections), and NAs (no recording during that interval). That table, the **detection matrix**, can readily be ingested by `spOccupancy`, `unmarked`, or `ubms` (e.g., via functions `PGOcc()`, `occu()`, or `stan_occu()`, respectively).

```{=html}
<!--
What external dependencies does the project have (e.g. libraries, services, other projects, etc.)?
-->
```

`birdnetTools` relies on several R packages to support its core functionality, including `av`, `tuneR`, and `seewave` for audio processing, and `dplyr` for data wrangling. A full list of dependencies is available in the `DESCRIPTION` file of the [`birdnetTools` repository](https://github.com/birdnet-team/birdnetTools).

provide at least a high-level description of the implementation.

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed
and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery

- Month 2: Finalize function specifications and data format requirements.

- Month 3: Develop and test initial occupancy-specific functions in `birdnetTools` (minimum viable product).

- Month 4: Create example workflows and vignettes demonstrating end-to-end analyses.

## Budget & funding plan

```{=html}
<!--
Outline the milestones for development and how much funding will be
required for each stage (as payments will be tied to project milestone
completion). Each milestone should specify the work to be done and the
expected outcomes, providing enough detail for the ISC to understand
the scope of the project work and assess the likelihood of success.

We expect that most of the budget will be allocated
for labor costs. We do not cover indirect costs. The ISC grants cannot
cover such things as travel, lodging, food, journal publication fees,
or personal hardware. Cloud services may be covered if they are specific
to the project and the project period. The ISC reserves the right to vet
how funds are used for each project separately. If in doubt, please reach
out to us.
-->
```

Estimated costs are based on a five-month project divided into three deliverable-based milestones, calculated at an hourly rate of **USD 36/hour**.

| Milestone | Deliverables | Hours (Sunny + Connor) | Estimated cost (USD) |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Phase 1 Planning (2025 Dec.1 - 31) | Finalize data formats and function specs. | 12 + 12 | \$864 |
| Phase 2 Development (2026 Jan.1 - Mar.31) | Implement core functions, create example workflows. | 80 + 16 | \$3,456 |
| Phase 3 Testing & release (2026 Apr.1 - 30) | Conduct community testing, refine code and documentation | 60 + 28 | \$3,168 |
| Total |  | 152 + 56 = 208 | \$7,488 |

# Success

```{=html}
<!--
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a
thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery
-->
```

This project will be considered successful when `birdnetTools 2.0` provides a stable, CRAN-ready release that enables users to convert BirdNET output into detection matrices and fit occupancy models in `spOccupancy`, `unmarked`, or `ubms` with minimal additional coding. Success will be measured by (1) the release of the new core function(s) (e.g., `birdnet_det_mat()`) and accompanying vignettes, (2) positive feedback and reproducible test results from community beta testing, and (3) adoption of the new workflow by early users as demonstrated through GitHub issues, discussions, and citations.

Building on the proposed detection-matrix functionality, a logical next step will be to develop additional helper functions that support occupancy model covariates. For example, a `birdnet_effort_mat()` function could generate a matrix with the same site × survey dimensions as the detection matrix but populated with the number of input audio files per interval. This “effort matrix” would provide a straightforward detection covariate for occupancy modeling and further streamline the workflow from raw audio to model-ready inputs.
