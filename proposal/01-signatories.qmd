# Signatories
<!--
This section provides the ISC with a view of the support received from
the community for a proposal. Acceptance isn't predicated on
popularity but community acceptance is important. Willingness to
accept outside input is also a good marker for project delivery.

An optional section would be for R-Core signatories where changes to R
are proposed.

## Project team
<!--
Who are the people responsible for actually delivering the project if
the proposal gets accepted and are already signed up and rearing to
go? Briefly describe all participants and the skills they will bring
to the project.

##### Sunny (Yi-Chin) Tseng – PhD Candidate, University of Northern British Columbia, Canada
Sunny is an avian bioacoustic ecologist and the creator of `birdnetTools`, an R package for post-processing BirdNET output, which was funded by an NSERC grant in Canada. She has also developed `bbsTaiwan` R package through the rOpenSci Championship program, for processing Breeding Bird Survey data in Taiwan. Sunny’s expertise combines bioacoustics and quantitative ecology to monitor bird communities at landscape scales. She has conducted bird-focused research in Siberia, Taiwan, Canada, and Lithuania, collecting audio recordings from over 300 species. For this project, Sunny will lead package development, maintain the repository, and update functions and documentation based on user feedback.

##### Connor M. Wood – Research Faculty, Cornell Lab of Ornithology
Connor leads the BirdNET Ecology Team, focusing on the application of BirdNET algorithms for landscape-scale biodiversity monitoring and community ecology. He has extensive experience developing and implementing bioacoustic tools to inform conservation strategies. Connor’s research emphasizes community-driven science, designing flexible tools that can be used by researchers, managers, and local communities. He has applied BirdNET to monitor bird species across large regions, generating data that supports both species-level conservation and broader ecosystem management. For this project, Connor will provide expertise on occupancy modeling and statistical methods, ensuring the package outputs are ecologically relevant and meet the needs of end users.
