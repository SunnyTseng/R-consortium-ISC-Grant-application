# Project plan

## Start-up phase
<!--
Covering the planning phase, this section should provide a relatively
detailed plan of how work will start on the project. This section is
important because projects need to get up and running quickly.


 - [ ] Setting up collaboration platform inc. code for contributors etc.
 - [ ] Licence decisions
 - [ ] Reporting framework
-->

The planning phase will be completed within the first month of the project (2025 Dec 31). Key activities include:

  - [ ] Confirm and document open-source license (MIT). 

  - [ ] Set up GitHub repository with contribution guidelines, code of conduct, and issue templates.

  - [ ] Establish reporting and feedback workflow via GitHub Issues/Discussions.

  - [ ] Draft initial project roadmap and share with collaborators for feedback.

  - [ ] Schedule bi-weekly check-ins between project contributors.






## Technical delivery
<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should
provide at least a high-level description of the implementation.

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed
and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery
-->

The technical delivery phase will span months 2 to 5 of the project. Key milestones include:

  - [ ] Month 2 (2026 Jan 31): Finalize function specifications and data format requirements in collaboration with `spOccupancy` developers.

  - [ ] Month 3 (2026 Feb 28): Develop and test initial versions of occupancy-specific functions in `birdnetTools` (i.e., the minimum viable product).

  - [ ] Month 4 (2026 Mar 31): Create example workflows and vignettes demonstrating end-to-end analyses.

  - [ ] Month 5 (2026 Apr 30): Conduct community testing, gather feedback, refine functions, and prepare for package release.




## Other aspects

<!--
How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number
of people? Please specify the open-source or creative commons license(s)
you will use, how you will host your code so that others can contribute,
and how you will publicize your work. We encourage you to plan content
to be shared quarterly on the R Consortium blog.

 - [ ] Announcement post
 - [ ] Delivery blog post
 - [ ] Social media
 - [ ] UseR!
 - [ ] ISC meetings
-->

The project will be conducted in an open and transparent manner to maximize accessibility, usability, and community engagement.

  - [ ] The code will be hosted publicly on GitHub under an MIT license, enabling collaboration, contributions, and long-term sustainability.

  - [ ] User feedback will be actively incorporated through GitHub issues, and package versions will be updated regularly with a clear changelog.

  - [ ] The package will be distributed via CRAN and/or the rOpenSci R-universe to ensure broad accessibility for R users worldwide.

  - [ ] Project updates and outcomes will be communicated through posts on the R Consortium blog, as well as via relevant R community events (e.g., useR! conference, ISC meetings).



## Budget & funding plan

<!--
Outline the milestones for development and how much funding will be
required for each stage (as payments will be tied to project milestone
completion). Each milestone should specify the work to be done and the
expected outcomes, providing enough detail for the ISC to understand
the scope of the project work and assess the likelihood of success.

We expect that most of the budget will be allocated
for labor costs. We do not cover indirect costs. The ISC grants cannot
cover such things as travel, lodging, food, journal publication fees,
or personal hardware. Cloud services may be covered if they are specific
to the project and the project period. The ISC reserves the right to vet
how funds are used for each project separately. If in doubt, please reach
out to us.
